<h1>Cover Art Archive</h1>

<p>
The Cover Art Archive is a joint project between the <a href="http://archive.org">Internet Archive</a> and 
<a href="http://musicbrainz.org">MusicBrainz</a>. The goal of the project is to make cover art images of
music releases available to everyone on the Internet. If you have the <a href="http://wiki.musicbrainz.org/MBID">MBID</a>
of a release you can construct a URL to retrieve the cover art for a given release. To find out more, please see
our <a href="http://wiki.musicbrainz.org/Cover_Art_Archive">Cover Art Archive documentation pages</a>.
</p>

<p>
To upload cover art images, log in to MusicBrainz (<a href="http://musicbrainz.org/register">create a MusicBrainz 
account</a>), <a href="http://musicbrainz.org/search">find a release</a> that needs cover art and click on the 
'cover art' tab in the release. Then click on the 'add cover art' link and follow the instructions.
</p>

<p>
The MusicBrainz community curates the collection of images in the archive. MusicBrainz users upload and
peer review uploads to the archive to ensure that the collection of images are correct, free of spam and
of the best possible quality. <strong>All of the images are stored on the Internet Archive's servers and never
touch MusicBrainz servers.</strong>
