To install this service, you will need to have the following python packages installed:

sqlalchemy
werkzeug
cherrypy

CherryPy is used as the WSGI server. To deploy, simply copy coverart_redirect.conf.dist
to coverart_redirect.conf, edit the settings to point to a MusicBrainz postgres install
and where to listen for connections.

Then run coverart_redirect_server.py to run the service. All logging goes to stdout,
including stacktraces, so its suitable for running inside of daemontools.
